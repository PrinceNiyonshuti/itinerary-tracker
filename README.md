# 1. Problems and findings

## Problems

- Adding data to array from another components
- maintaining the state of the components when you add or delete new data
- failed to build the project on Netlify

## Findings

- React useEffect to handle data before data loads to the DOM and after it loads
- using Json Server to hold data to be used while fetching them like an API
- using Reach history to reload or push to a new route using the history prop
- handling and mastering use of the state and conditional rendering

# 2. Time Taken to Complete

- its been 5 to 7 hours working on the project

# 3. Your coding style and standards

- the coding style is used was line coding and error control and
  the standard of using safe ,secure and portable codes

# 4. Your source code files plus the final (e.g. compiled) result that can be opened directly in a browser
